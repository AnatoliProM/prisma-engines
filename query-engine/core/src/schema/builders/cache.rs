///! Every builder is required to cache input and output type refs that are created inside
///! of them, e.g. as soon as the builder produces a ref, it must be retrievable later.
///!
///! This has two purposes:
///! - First, circular dependencies, as they can happen in input / output types, are broken.
///! - Second, it serves as a central list of build types of that builder, which are used later to
///!   collect all types of the query schema.
///!
///! The cached types are stored as Arcs, and the cache owns these (strong) Arcs,
///! while the cache will only hand out weak arcs. not only does this simplify the builder architecture,
///! but also prevents issues with memory leaks in the schema, as well as issues that when all strong
///! arcs are dropped due to visitor operations, the schema can't be traversed anymore due to invalid references
///!
