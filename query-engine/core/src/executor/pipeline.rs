//! Handles query pipelines with mixed read-write queries
//!
//! The general information flow is as follows:
//!
//! - Run pre-fetch queries for every delete
//! - Run mutations
//! - Run other queries
//!
//! When running pre-fetch queries, the results need to be cached
//! and also those queries need to first be derived from the WriteQuery
//! they are based on.
//!
//! The `pipeline` module itself doesn't do this and relies on the
//! mutation builders for a lot of this. But the general lifecycle
//! of queries is implemented here
